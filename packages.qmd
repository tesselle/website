## Count data
### tabula

[<img class="hex-logo" alt="tabula" src="images/tabula.png" />](https://packages.tesselle.org/tabula/ "Read the documentation.") An easy way to examine archaeological count data. **tabula** provides several tests and measures of diversity: heterogeneity and evenness (Brillouin, Shannon, Simpson, etc.), richness and rarefaction (Chao1, Chao2, ACE, ICE, etc.), turnover and similarity (Brainerd-Robinson, etc.). The package make it easy to visualize count data and statistical thresholds: rank vs. abundance plots, heatmaps, @ford1962 and @bertin1977 diagrams.

### dimensio

[<img class="hex-logo" alt="dimensio" src="images/dimensio.png" />](https://packages.tesselle.org/dimensio/ "Read the documentation.") Simple Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Correspondence Analysis (CA) based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This package provides S4 classes and methods to compute, extract, summarize and visualize results of multivariate data analysis. It also includes methods for partial bootstrap validation described in @greenacre1984 and @lebart2006. [Read the doc...](https://packages.tesselle.org/dimensio/)

## Signal processing
### alkahest

[<img class="hex-logo" alt="arkhe" src="images/alkahest.png" />](https://packages.tesselle.org/alkahest/ "Read the documentation.") A lightweight, dependency-free toolbox for pre-processing XY data from experimental methods (i.e. any signal that can be measured along a continuous variable). This package provides methods for baseline estimation and correction, smoothing, normalization, integration and peaks detection. [Read the doc...](https://packages.tesselle.org/alkahest/)

## Data visualization
### khroma

[<img class="hex-logo" alt="khroma" src="images/khroma.png" />](https://packages.tesselle.org/khroma/ "Read the documentation.") Colour schemes ready for each type of data (qualitative, diverging or sequential), with colours that are distinct for all people, including colour-blind readers. This package provides an implementation of Paul Tol (2018) and Fabio Crameri (2018) colour schemes for use with `graphics` or [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2). It provides tools to simulate colour-blindness and to test how well the colours of any palette are identifiable. Several scientific thematic schemes (geologic timescale, land cover, FAO soils, etc.) are also implemented. [Read the doc...](https://packages.tesselle.org/khroma/)

### isopleuros

[<img class="hex-logo" alt="isopleuros" src="images/isopleuros.png" />](https://packages.tesselle.org/isopleuros/ "Read the documentation.") Ternary plots made simple. This package allows to create ternary plot using `graphics`. It provides functions to display the data in the ternary space, to add or tune graphical elements and to display statistical summaries. It also includes common ternary diagrams useful for the archaeologist (e.g. soil texture charts, ceramic phase diagram). [Read the doc...](https://packages.tesselle.org/isopleuros/)
