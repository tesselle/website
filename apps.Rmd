```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Note that for now all these apps are prototypes, so please think twice before using it for anything serious.

```{r cards}
apps <- read.csv("_data/apps.csv")
bs4cards::cards(
  data = apps,
  title = name, 
  text = description,
  image = image,
  link = url,
  footer = url,
  tags = paste("all;", tags),
  width = 4,
  layout = "label-right"
)
```
